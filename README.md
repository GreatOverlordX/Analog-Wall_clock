# Analog-Wall_clock
This project aims to create a creative and modern analog clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The analog clock will display the current time with hour, minute, and second hands, providing an interactive and visually appealing way to view the time. This project has been done in based on Dinil's Analog project (credits in the html.index).
